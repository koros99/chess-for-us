         <p>Chess is a strategy game played on an 8x8 board with white and black squares. Each player has 16 pieces, and each piece has its own moves. The king is the most important piece on the board, while the queen is the most powerful piece. A nice balance of matriachy and patriachy, right? Watch the video for a crash course through chess.</p>

         <p>There are a few openings that set up a nice game for you. The most common are the king's and queen's gambit that involve playing the pawn in front of the king and queen respectively two steps as the first move. The video illustrates the top aggressive openings.</p>

         <p>The mid game another important part of the game. One could say mid game starts from after the first five or six moves. An important tip for the mid game is taking control of the center of the board. Also, don't capture carelessly. Be smart!</p>

        <p>Every time is chess time. Ever thought about the worth of a pawn? Well, not many people value pawns. However, these pawns could easily destroy your en-castle defence, and they could chart their way through your sicilian like knife through butter. watch the video to learn more about using pawns effectively.</p>

        <p>Sicilian defense is a defense black plays against a king's gambit by playing his right bishop's pawn and subsequently opening some of his other pieces such as the knights, setting up a powerful defense. Watch the video to learn more about playing and countering sicilian defense.</p>

         <h4>Castling.</h4>
         <img src="https://skillsology.com/wc/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/chess1.jpg" id="castleimage">
         <p>En castle is perhaps the strongest defense one could set up in a game. The short castle is the most common, but both castles set up a formidable defense of pawns and the rook. A nice way to ensure the defense stands is moving pawn, g3(for white) and g6(for black) one step, moving bishop to the space the pawn occupied, Bg2 for white and Bg7 for black, then finally castling to the right. This frees the bishop and at the same time uses the bishop to set up a strong defense.</p>
